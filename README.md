# PySonar2 - a type inferencer and indexer library for Python

PySonar2 is a type inferencer and indexer library for Python, designed for analysing large code bases.
The resulting index can be used to build code browsers and code search engines.

PySonar2 has a sophisticated type system and whole-project interprocedural analysis to infer types
and locate definitions. It handles first-class functions (closures) and control flow correctly.
As a result, the accuracy of the index often outperforms Python IDEs such as PyCharm.

PySonar2 uses advanced analysis techniques similar to control-flow analysis (k-CFA, CFA2, etc), but
with a much simpler theory and without their drawbacks. It is both highly accurate and highly performant,
thus it became the choice of several large scale code index infrastructures,

Major users include:

- Google
- Sourcegraph
- Insight.io (now part of Elastic)

### How to build

    mvn package -DskipTests


### Demo

To have a feel of what PySonar2 produce, you can build a simple code browser of the Python 2.7
standard library with the following command line:

    java -jar target/pysonar-<version>.jar /usr/lib/python2.7 ./html

This may take a few minutes depending on your machine. You should find some interactive HTML files
inside the _html_ directory after this process. You can move your mouse on the variables and click
on them to jump to definitions etc.

Note that this is just a simple demo program based on the library. PySonar2 is not meant to be an
end-user tool. It is mainly designed as a library for Python IDEs, developer tools and code search
engines, so its interface may not be as appealing as an end-user tool.

If you have problems with it, please feel free to contact me.


### System requirements

* Python 2.7.x
* Python 3.x
* Java 8+
* maven


### Environment variables

PySonar2 uses CPython's built-in `ast` package to parse Python code, so please make sure you have
`python` or `python3` installed and pointed to by the `PATH` environment variable. If you have them
in different names, please make symbol links.

`PYTHONPATH` environment variable is used for locating the Python standard libraries. It is
important to point it to the correct Python library, for example

    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7

If this is not set up correctly, references to library code will not be found.


### Contribute

You are welcome to make code contributions.

Because of the highly complex and unpublished theory behind PySonar2, things may go wrong easily
with even an innocent-looking change. If you hope to contribute to PySonar2, please discuss with me
first before making significant changes, otherwise I may not be able to review your changes.

For basic verification, you can run the unit tests. PySonar2 has a basic test framework. You can run
the tests using this command:

    mvn test

If you modify the code or tests, you need to generate new expected results. Run these command lines:

    mvn package -DskipTests
    java -classpath target/pysonar-<version>.jar org.yinwang.pysonar.TestInference -generate tests

To write new tests, you just need to write relevant Python code demonstrating your change, put them
into a directory named `tests/testname.test`(test directory name must end with ".test"). Please look
at the `tests` directory for examples.

Please don't expect the tests to catch all bugs. Be very careful :)
